# Front-end tech test

carwow has decided to build a new interface for users to compare cars on its’ website.

Our design team came up with the early-stage wireframes below for this purpose.

Users can access a list of cars with their primary information. Items in the list can be clicked/tapped to access further details. You can decide which information is relevant to show on each screen.

## API

Use the following endpoint to display the list of cars: <https://boiling-chamber-77385.herokuapp.com/models>
