# Front-end tech test

carwow has decided to build a new interface for users to compare cars on itsâ€™ website.

Our design team came up with the early-stage wireframes below for this purpose.

![Index cards wireframe](img/index.png "Index cards wireframe")

![Show cards wireframe](img/show.png "Show cards wireframe")

Users can access a list of cars with their primary information. Items in the list can be clicked/tapped to access further details. You can decide which information is relevant to show on each screen.

## API

Use the following endpoints to display the cars' information:

- List of cars: <https://warm-dawn-92320.herokuapp.com/models>
- Details of a single car: <https://warm-dawn-92320.herokuapp.com/model/1> (replace 1 with the ID of the car)
